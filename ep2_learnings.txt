//pacakage.json : Manages your project's dependencies and metadata.
-it is a configuration for npm
-each dependency has it's own package.json


//bundler bundles/pacakages your app so we can push it to production
ex parcel
//HMR - hor module replacement
//it creates cashe files in our project folder so every time we save or execute it can speed up the process.
//it also does image optimization, minification,compressing


//there are two type of dependecies
1. dev dependency : (parcel, Babel, jest, webpack, ESlint)
-Used only during development, such as testing libraries, build tools, or linters. Not included in the production build.

2. normal dependency  : (React,Express, Axios, Lodash)
-Required for the application to run in production, like React, Express, or other core libraries. These are included in the 
production build


^ (Caret): 
-Allows updates to the package that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit in the version. 
-ex: ^2.12.0 allows updates to any version >=2.12.0 and <3.0.0.

~ (Tilde): 
-Allows updates to the package that only change the rightmost digit in the version. 
-ex: ~2.12.0 allows updates to any version >=2.12.0 and <2.13.0.


// package-lock.json: 
-records the exact versions of all dependencies (including nested dependencies) that were installed when 
 you first ran npm install or added a package. 
-This ensures that every time someone else installs your project, they get the exact same versions of the dependencies that
 were originally installed, providing consistency and avoiding potential issues caused by different versions of packages.
-because of this we can later download the exact node modules using 'npm install'.


//node_modules
-it fetches the code of all the dependecies in our code.
-it is kind of like database where all our packages exist.


//.gitignore
-If you don't want to push some files into production add them .gitignore file, it won't push them there
-whatever you can regenerate don't put it on github
